=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use AnyEvent::PgRecvlogical;

    my $recv = AnyEvent::PgRecvlogical->new(
        dbname     => 'mydb',
        slot       => 'myreplslot',
        on_message => sub {
            my ($record, $guard) = @_;

            process($record);

            undef $guard; # declare done with $record
        }
    );

    $recv->start;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<AnyEvent::PgRecvlogical> provides perl bindings of similar functionality to that of
L<pg_recvlogical|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgrecvlogical.html>.
The reasoning being that C<pg_recvlogical> does afford the consuming process the opportunity to emit feedback to
PostgreSQL. This results is potentially being sent more data than you can handle in a timely fashion.

Otherwise, one will be raised.

=item C<reconnect>

=over

=item L<Bool|Types::Standard/Bool>, Default: C<1>

=back

If true, will attempt to reconnect to the server and resume logical replication in the event the connection fails.
Otherwise, the connection will gracefully be allowed to close.

=item C<reconnect_delay>

=over

=item L<Int|Types::Standard/Int>, Default: C<5>

=back

Time, in seconds, to wait before reconnecting.

=item C<reconnect_limit>

=over

=item L<Int|Types::Standard/Int>, Default: C<1>

=back

Number of times to attempt reconnecting. If this limit is exceded, an exception will be thrown.

=item C<heartbeat>

=item L<Int|Types::Standard/Int>, Default: C<10>

=back

Interval, in seconds, to report our progress to the PostgreSQL server.

=item C<plugin>

=item L<LSN|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/datatype-pg-lsn.html>, Default: C<0/0>

=back

Start replication from the given LSN. Also accepts the integer form, but that is considered advanced usage.

=back

Callback in the event of an error.

=item C<on_message>

=over

=item L<CodeRef|Types::Standard/CodeRef>, Required

=back

Callback to receive the replication payload from the server. This is the raw output from the L</plugin>.

The callback is passed the C<$payload> received and a C<$guard> object. Hang onto the C<$guard> until you have handled
the payload. Once it is released, the server will be informed that the WAL position has been "flushed."

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

All the L</"ATTRIBUTES"> above are accepted by the constructor, with a few exceptions:

L</"received_lsn"> and L<"flushed_lsn"> are read-only and not accepted by the constructor.

L</"dbname">, L</"slot"> and L</"on_message"> are required.

Note, that logical replication will not automatically commence upon construction. One must call L</"start"> first.

=head1 METHODS

All L</"ATTRIBUTES"> are also accesible via methods. They are all read-only.

=over

=item start

Initialize the logical replication process asyncronously and return immediately. This performs the following steps:

=over

=item 1. L</"identify_system">

=item 2. L</"create_slot"> (if requested)

=item 3. L</"start_replication">

=item 4. heartbeat timer

=back

This method wraps the above steps for convenience. Should you desire to modify the
L<replication startup protocol|https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/protocol-replication.html> (which you
shouldn't), the methods are described in detail below.

Returns: L<Promises::Promise>

=cut

sub start {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->_post_init(
        deferred {
            shift->chain($self->curry::identify_system, $self->curry::create_slot, $self->curry::start_replication);
        }
    );
}

sub _post_init {
    my ($self, $d) = @_;

    return $d->then(
        sub {
            $self->_fh_watch;
            $self->_timer;
        },
        $self->on_error,
    );
}

=item identify_system

Issues the C<IDENTIFY_SYSTEM> command to the server to put the connection in repliction mode.

Returns: L<Promises::Promise>

=cut

sub identify_system {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->dbh->do('IDENTIFY_SYSTEM', { pg_async => PG_ASYNC });
    return _async_await($self->dbh);
}

=item create_slot

Issues the appropriate C<CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT> command to the server, if requested.

Returns: L<Promises::Promise>

=cut

sub create_slot {
    my $self = shift;

    return deferred->resolve unless $self->do_create_slot;

    my $dbh = $self->dbh;
    $dbh->do(

            $dbh->quote_identifier($self->slot),

            ($dbh->{pg_server_version} >= PG_MIN_NOEXPORT ? ' NOEXPORT_SNAPSHOT' : '')    # uncoverable branch true
        ),
        { pg_async => PG_ASYNC }
    );

    return _async_await($dbh)->catch(
        sub {

    }

    return @opts ? sprintf('(%s)', join q{, }, @opts) : q{};    # uncoverable branch false
}

=item start_replication

Issues the C<START_REPLICATION SLOT> command and immediately returns. The connection will then start receiving
logical replication payloads.

=cut

sub start_replication {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->dbh->do(
        sprintf(
            'START_REPLICATION SLOT %s LOGICAL %s%s',

            $LSNStr->coerce($self->startpos),
            $self->_option_string
        ),
    );
}

=item pause

Pauses reading from the database. Useful for throttling the inbound flow of data so as to not overwhelm your
application. It is safe, albeit redundant, to call this method multiple time in a row without unpausing.

=cut

sub pause { shift->_clear_fh_watch; return; }

=item unpause

Resume reading from the database. After a successful L</pause>, this will pick right back reciving data and sending it
to the provided L</callback>. It is safe, albeit redundant, to call this method multiple time in a row without pausing.

=cut

sub unpause { shift->_fh_watch; return; }

=item is_paused

Returns the current pause state.

Returns: boolean
